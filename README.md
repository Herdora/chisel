Quick Example

Here's how easy it is to run a PyTorch model on cloud GPUs:
# your_model.py
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from kandc import capture_model_class

@capture_model_class(model_name="SimpleModel")
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(784, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Train your model...
model = MyModel()
x = torch.randn(32, 784)
output = model(x)  # This gets automatically profiled!

# Run on cloud GPUs with one command
kandc python your_model.py

That's it! Your model runs on high-performance GPUs with automatic profiling. 🎉
